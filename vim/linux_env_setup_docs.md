# Linux Enviroment Setup Documentation

We want to setup a Linux Environment for doing basic programming.

***

## Configure a Linux OS

For this documentation, we will consider using WSL. Otherwise, you may skip this step if you already have it pre-installed.

Install WSL by executing the command ```wsl --install``` in Command Prompt or Windows Powershell.

*Note: You may need to enable WSL in Windows Features if you are getting permission errors.*

If using WSL, we will also download Ubuntu and Windows Terminal from the Microsoft Store.

Configure Windows Terminal to include a new profile to open Ubuntu.

Setup Ubuntu by setting a username and password.
