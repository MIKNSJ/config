Steps to configurating the latest .vimrc file listed for cpp

We are using regular vim as neovim is not required.

Install vim_plug using, if Windows Laptop, the powershell command.

Install clangd (c/cpp suggestions) by LLVM (separate installation and automatically connects to Windows User Path).

*This is a better option then starting with the ```:CocInstall``` and ```:CocCommand``` commands first resulting in a potential pathing issue of clangd.* \


With the plug-in manager:

Install coc.nvim \


With the plug-in manager:

Install the remaining plug-ins for VIM.

More information regarding each plug-in based on the name of the plug-in.
