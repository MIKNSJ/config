Steps to configurating the latest .vimrc file listed for cpp

We are using regular vim as neovim is not required.
Install vim_plug using, if Windows Laptop, the powershell command.
Install clangd (c/cpp suggestions) by LLVM (separate installation and automatically connects to Windows User Path).
*This is a better option then trying to work with ```:CocInstall``` and ```:CocCommand``` commands resulting in a potential pathing issue of clangd.*

With the plug-in manager:
Install plug-ins for VIM.
More information regarding each plug-in based on the name of the plug-in.
